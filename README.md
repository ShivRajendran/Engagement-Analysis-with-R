#SAhistory.R

Multiple Data sets for 2015-2018. Each csv file contained responses to that years engagement survey. Questions were asked with answers ranging from 1-5 (disagree-agree). Survey questions were broken up into seperate sections: Accountability, Communication, Organizational effectiveness, and etc. For each question Historical average response was recorded and plotted using ggplot. Plots were compiled to see how employee moral and opinion has changed over time. 
ggplot was used to create all plots, while ggsave saved all plot images as pngs for use in reports.
